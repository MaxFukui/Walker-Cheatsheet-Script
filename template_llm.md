I have a cheatsheet system that uses markdown files with a specific format. Please create a cheatsheet for [TOPIC/TOOL NAME].

Format requirements:
1. The first line MUST be a markdown header (# Title) that will appear in the menu
2. Each command line must follow this exact format: Description | command
3. Keep descriptions concise but clear (under 50 characters is ideal)
4. Keep commands practical and commonly used
5. Include 15-25 commands (enough to be useful, not overwhelming)
6. Group related commands together logically
7. No empty lines between commands (they will be ignored anyway, but keep it clean)
8. No additional markdown formatting (no bold, italic, code blocks, etc.)
9. No comments or explanations outside the format

Example structure:
```markdown
# Tool Name - Brief Description

Description of command | actual command here
Another command | command syntax
Third command | command with <placeholder>
```

Please generate a cheatsheet for: [YOUR TOPIC HERE]

Make it practical and focused on commands I would actually use frequently.
